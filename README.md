# -Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction

  The following conclusions are made as per my discussion with my team, and this is my contribution.
              I selected the best features for predictive modeling by using K best feature selection method using Chi square statistic. Implemented various classification algorithms, out of which the SVM (Support vector machine) algorithm gave the best performance after hyper-parameter tuning with 98.3% train accuracy and 97 % test accuracy.
              In Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, I performed on experiment Gradient Boosting Classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM)
